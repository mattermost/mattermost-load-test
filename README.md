# Mattermost Load Test

The Mattermost Load Test provides infrastructure for simulating real-world usage of the Mattermost Enterprise Edition E20 at scale. 

This guide will help you:

1. Deploy Mattermost in a production configuration, potentially in high availability mode.
2. Deploy a Mattermost Load Test server to apply simulated load to your production deployment.
3. Interpret the results of the load test and debug any problems.

If you have questions about configuration, please contact your Account Manager. An overview of support available to E20 customers is available at https://about.mattermost.com/support/

## Requirements

SOFTWARE

- **Software required for Mattermost production deployment** - see [Software and Hardware Requirements Guide](https://docs.mattermost.com/install/requirements.html) for software requirements 

HARDWARE

- **Hardware required for Mattermost production deployment** - see [Software and Hardware Requirements Guide](https://docs.mattermost.com/install/requirements.html) for sizing hardware based on projected needs
- **Load Test Server** - to run Load Tests with hardware similar to Mattermost application server in production setup

## Running the tests

To run the Load Test simulation, complete the following: 

### 1) Set up your Load Test environment 

Follow the regular Mattermost setup instructions. Make sure you pick large enough machines in a configuration that will support the load you are testing for. 
Make sure you follow the optional instructions for performance.

Do not forget to set your ulimits properly. 

### 2) Set up your server that will be running the load tests

The hardware specifications of the server running Load Test should be similar to the hardware of your application server. 

Install the `loadtest` command on the Load Test server. You can use `make package` to get a `tar.gz` under the `dist` directory.

### 3) Edit the configuration file `loadtestconfig.json`

Edit the configuration file on the load test machine. Make sure the fields under "ConnectionConfiguration" are set correctly.

You can find explanations of the configuration fields in the [Configruation File Documentation](loadtestconfig.md)

### 4) Run the tests

Now you can run the tests from the Load Test machine by using the command `loadtest all`. 

A summary of activity will be output to the console so you can monitor the test. When the test is complete, a summary will be printed and saved to a file called results.txt


## Common issues

# "Unable to set X. System Console is set to read-only when High Availability is enabled"

If you see this error the loadtests are trying to set a configuration setting but can't because HA mode is enabled. You will need to manually update your cofiguration.
The settings needed are:
EnableOpenServer: true
MaxUsersPerTeam: 50000 (or more)
MaxChannelsPerTeam: 50000 (or more)
EnableIncomingWebhooks: true
EnableAdminOnlyIntegrations: false


## Compliling for non master branch Mattermost

Note that the loadtests only support master and possibly 1 version back (although you may need to use a branch)

1. Edit the `glide.yaml` file under `github.com/mattermost/platform` change `version: master` to the branch you want to build against. For a release the branch is called `release-x-x`, eg `release-3.9`
2. run `make clean`
3. run `make package`

## Look for slow SQL queries in MySQL

Considering using the following: 

   SET GLOBAL log_output = 'TABLE';
   SET GLOBAL slow_query_log = 'ON'; 
   SET GLOBAL long_query_time = 1;
   SET GLOBAL log_queries_not_using_indexes = 'OFF';

   show global variables WHERE Variable_name IN ('log_output', 'slow_query_log', 'long_query_time', 'long_query_time', 'log_queries_not_using_indexes');

   SELECT *, CAST(sql_text AS CHAR(10000) CHARACTER SET utf8) AS Query FROM mysql.slow_log ORDER BY start_time DESC LIMIT 100 

   TRUNCATE mysql.slow_log; 


To process the logs use mysqldumpslow::
 - mysqldumpslow -s c -t 100 mysql-slowquery.log > top100-c.log
 - mysqldumpslow -s r -t 100 mysql-slowquery.log > top100-r.log
 - mysqldumpslow -s ar -t 100 mysql-slowquery.log > top100-ar.log
 - mysqldumpslow -s t -t 100 mysql-slowquery.log > top100-t.log
 - mysqldumpslow -s at -t 100 mysql-slowquery.log > top100-at.log
 - grep "FROM Status" mysql-slowquery.log | wc -l

## Generate profiling data

Start the server with: 

   ./bin/platform -httpprofiler


Look at different profiles with:

   - go tool pprof platform http://localhost:8065/debug/pprof/profile
   - go tool pprof platform http://localhost:8065/debug/pprof/heap
   - go tool pprof platform http://localhost:8065/debug/pprof/block
   - go tool pprof platform http://localhost:8065/debug/pprof/goroutine
